summary: "Economists espousing a minor carbon dividend plan isn't surprising. But Janet Yellen, Marty Feldstein, and the oil-backed Climate Leadership Council seem to have purposely misappropriated and misrepresented the thousands of signatories' support to fabricate a non-existent consensus against complementary climate policy, namely green public works and subsidy programs."

Some second impressions on that statement [signed by 3,300+
economists](https://www.econstatement.org/) advocating for an American
carbon dividend program, [\"the largest public declaration in the
history of
economics\"](https://twitter.com/MartinRavallion/status/1097253630426652672).

Putting a price on carbon is, as the number of signatories suggests, a
fairly obvious and uncontroversial proposal that has been economic
consensus for decades. In fact, a 1997 [\"Economists\' statement on
climate
change\"](https://twitter.com/Undercoverhist/status/1097632145680543744)
had a comparable 2,500 signatories though it also espoused a
cap-and-trade scheme on top of the carbon tax. The rebate part proposed
here is a surprising inclusion, but hardly revolutionary. Getting this
many signatories was always going to be fairly easy and justifiable.

However, it appears that what was originally a fairly uncontroversial
[opinion piece published in the *Wall Street
Journal*](https://www.wsj.com/articles/economists-statement-on-carbon-dividends-11547682910)
on behalf of the American economics academy has been co-opted by the
Climate Leadership Council. There appear to be two homepages for the
proposal: [econstatement.org](https://www.econstatement.org/) where
assenting economists were directed and [the CLC
homepage](https://www.clcouncil.org/economists-statement/), which claims
ownership of the editorial and to have organized the proposal. Who are
the CLC? This is from their website:

> *The Climate Leadership Council is an international policy institute
> founded in collaboration with aÂ [who\'s
> who](https://www.clcouncil.org/founding-members/)Â of business, opinion
> and environmental leaders to promote a carbon dividends framework as
> the most cost-effective, equitable and politically-viable climate
> solution.*

The \"who\'s who of business\" refers to these guys according to their
website:

Hmm. Their [prior work](https://www.clcouncil.org/endorsements/) page is
a pretty long list of editorials published in the most prominent
American publications describing this same carbon dividend plan as a
\"Republican\" or \"conservative\" plan against climate change.

[According to the
FT](https://www.ft.com/content/fa0815fe-3299-11e9-bd3a-8b2a211d90d5),
the CLC organized this \"bipartisan effort that has united senior
economists from both parties.\"

I find that odd. Nowhere on econstatement.org, where potential
signatories were directed, does it mention the CLC, which is
self-described as partisan. And nothing about a carbon dividend plan is
particularly partisan unless you [misrepresent this economic consensus
as evidence the academy espouses a carbon dividend plan ***as a
substitute*** for a Green New Deal-type stimulus
program](https://www.ft.com/content/fa0815fe-3299-11e9-bd3a-8b2a211d90d5):

> *But Ms Yellen told the Financial Times the Green New Deal was costly,
> whereas the carbon tax, which would plough proceeds back to the public
> in dividend payments, would be the \"most efficient way\" to reduce
> emissions... Ms Yellen said a carbon tax and dividend would be more
> \"feasible\" and \"sensible\" than the Green New Deal in its current

The claims in bold are not at all what 3,300 economists agreed to by
attaching their names to the statement. Nowhere in the statement did
they suggest the proposed carbon dividend program be used as a
substitute for more ambitious spending programs. Further, I haven\'t
looked at all into the details of the AOC draft of a Green New Deal
proposal, but my understanding is that it would also include a
progressive carbon tax scheme not unlike the ones these 3,300+
signatories endorse. This carbon tax scheme *is precisely* a \"method
proposed by proponents of the Green New Deal.\" To misrepresent climate
policy as a choice between the two seems like bad-faith argumentation if
not intentional deception. As I understood it initially, Dr. Yellen and
others organized the proposal independent of the CLC. Did all
signatories know this wasn\'t the case? I\'m not sure. Did all
signatories agree to this framing of their support as anti-Green New
Deal? Clearly not, \'cause here\'s one:

Separately, I don\'t know yet what to make of Dr. Bill Nordhaus---who
just accepted the Nobel Prize for his work in climate change economics
just two months ago and was an advocate of carbon taxation as early as
the 1970s---not co-signing.
