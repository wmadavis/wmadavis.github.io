### [Guillermo Del Toro on Roma (2018)](https://twitter.com/RealGDT/status/1084701184110153729?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%22)

A tweet thread on his countryman and friend's masterpiece now nominated
for Best Picture:

\<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"\>\<p lang="en" dir="ltr"\>10 personal
musings about ROMA. \<br\>\<br\>1) The opening shot suggests that earth
(the shit-infested ground) and heaven (the plane) are irreconcilably far
even if they are joined -momentarily- and revealed, by water (the
reflection). All truths in ROMA are revealed by water.\</p\>---

\<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"\>\<p lang="en" dir="ltr"\>5) In every
sense, ROMA is a Fresco, a Mural, not a portrait. Not only the way it is
lensed but the way it "scrolls" with long lateral dollies. The audio
visual information (context, social unrest, factions & politics / morals
of the time) exists within the frame to be read.\</p\>--- Guillermo del

### [Robert Caro on his research process](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2019/01/28/the-secrets-of-lyndon-johnsons-archives)

It pairs nicely with Seymour Hersh's memoir, *Reporter,* which I've
mentioned in this space before.

> *Finally, he raised his head. "I didn't know someone from Princeton
> could do digging like this," he said. "From now on, you do
> investigative work."*
>
> *I responded with my usual savoir faire: "But I don't know anything
> about investigative reporting."*
>
> *Alan looked at me for what I remember as a very long time. "Just
> remember," he said. "Turn every page. Never assume anything. Turn
> every goddam page." He turned to some other papers on his desk, and
> after a while I got up and left.*

Caro is best known for the obsessive research underlying his biographies
of Robert Moses and Lyndon B. Johnson. The latter has been a four-volume
project (publications in 1982, 1990, 2002, and 2012) with a fifth and
concluding volume characteristically overdue. His next book, "Working",
is a memoir and is due out in a few months:

> *Why am I publishing these random recollections toward a memoir while
> I'm still working on the last volume of the Johnson biography, when I
> haven't finished it, while I'm still---at the age of
> eighty-three---several years from finishing it? Why don't I just
> include this material in the longer, full-length memoir I'm hoping to
> write?*
>
> *The answer is, I'm afraid, quite obvious.. I am well aware that I may
> never get to write the memoir, although I have so many thoughts about
> writing, so many anecdotes about research, that I would like to
> preserve for anyone interested enough to read them. I decided that,
> just in case, I'd put some of them down on paper now.*

I also recommend listening to [his appearance last year on the *New
Yorker* Radio
Hour](https://www.wnycstudios.org/story/robert-caro-fall-new-york)
(embedded below), which he at the end calls the best interview he's ever
had. Read also [this interview with the *New York
Review*](https://www.nybooks.com/daily/2018/01/16/studies-in-power-an-interview-with-robert-caro/).
I have not read any of his books.

### [A reply to the *New York Review* article on the rise of the European right](https://www.nybooks.com/articles/2019/01/17/how-to-write-about-the-right-an-exchange/)

> *I have interviewed a number of the characters Mark Lilla cites in his
> essay' 'Two Roads for the New French Right'. Lilla's account fails to
> confront the white supremacy at the heart of a movement he ultimately
> describes as a 'coherent worldview'.' Although he is correct that
> there are important evolutions underway on the French and European
> right, he overlooks an implacable bigotry that remains the essence of
> the project. Any responsible discussion of the movement's new
> developments must begin and end there.*

And Lilla replies:

> *Writing about the political right has never been harder. Different
> kinds of right-wing ideologies and political formations are
> proliferating and shaking liberal governments around the world... This
> makes it difficult to keep track of all the developments, distinguish
> them, and establish the connections between them. At the same time,
> liberal and left forces that want to resist these developments are
> increasingly hostile to learning anything that does not conform to
> their settled ideas about the right.*

> *A reader of McAurley's letter who had not seen the piece might come
> to a different conclusion: that it was intended to whitewash Marion
> [MarÃ©chal ] (or her grandfather, or right-wing forces everywhere; it's
> unclear which) and ignore the real animating forces on the right,
> which are 'white supremacy,' 'hatred of the other,' 'bigotry,' and 'an
> ideology of exclusion,' all whipped up by the phantom of immigration.
> In other words, never mind all the things that seem new, forget the
> writings about family and sexuality, forget all the talk about organic
> community, forget the lashing out against neoliberalism and tech
> giants, forget Pope Francis. It all comes down to hatred: 'Any
> responsible discussion of the movement's new developments must begin
> and end there.'*

### [A new study advances non-line-of-sight imaging](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-00174-1)

(That refers to the technology of using shadows to photograph objects
outside direct line of sight. Obviously.)

The study claims it can take these photographs by only requiring a
single photograph and a standard digital camera. It is also
path-breaking in being the first paper I know of to include a [Super
Mushroom](https://www.mariowiki.com/Super_Mushroom) from the Super Mario
series. In fact, in appears three times (Figures 1,2, and 4).
