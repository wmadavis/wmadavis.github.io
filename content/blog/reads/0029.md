summary: "People are dying in hospitals and dying at home. The official tolls are almost certainly an undercount. The morgues are overflowing. Those are the facts. But where is the grief? When we first started getting the news out of Italy, and then Spain, with frightening daily numbers comparable with what is now happening in New York, that news seemed to be delivered with holy awe. In El País, for example, each day’s news was led by the previous day’s dead, a number that was often in the paper’s main headline. In the American papers, I usually have to do some searching to find how many people have died in the past day. The front pages here seem to often carry news of the financial markets or of the political squabbles of the day. But what I want is to be directly confronted with the fact, the enormity, the irreducible sadness of all these deaths."

One of the one-star reviews:

The exploitation comes not just from employers exercising monopsony
power, but also the pressure of the government and the public. Recall
Senator [Lindsey Graham
objecting](https://twitter.com/wmdecon/status/1243733740641308674) to a
bill to raise unemployment benefits because raising them would
disincentivize nurses from working. So employers and the government have
both coerced essential workers into providing hazard labor
uncompensated.

The \'essentiality\' of this labor, which theoretically would give labor
bargaining power to raise wages, is turned against their suppliers by a
[cynical appeal to an unspoken
duty](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/04/i-work-grocery-store-dont-call-me-hero/610147/)
to accept uncompensated hazards. In March, an [emergency physician wrote
this](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/03/were-failing-doctors/608662/)
in *The Atlantic:*

> *How much risk do health-care workers have to take? Or, more bluntly:
> How many of us will die before we start to walk away from our jobs?...
> I\'ve been to disasters all over the world, and I have always seen
> health-care providers pour in to help... But that sort of bravery,
> that work ethic, is not boundless. No one is so fearless or stupid as
> to discount all risks... Multiple studies have asked health-care
> providers whether they would go to work during various disaster
> scenarios. The answer is a resounding yes for earthquakes, floods, and
> even war. But pandemics are different.*

> *Yes, physicians and nurses have an ethical duty to provide care....
> We have an obligation to treat all patients, because we chose our
> profession and are well rewarded by society with money and respect...
> But there are few, if any, obligations for all the support staff that
> make my work possible---the techs, clerks, registrars, environmental
> staff. They don\'t take an oath. Some are paid minimum wage, have few
> benefits, and get none of the societal accolades reserved for doctors
> and nurses. Why should they die for a \$25,000-a-year job and \$10,000
> worth of life insurance? Who\'s going to feed their kids when they\'re
> gone? When you\'re the one wearing a flimsy paper gown and mask in the
> same room as someone dying from an invisible virus that makes its home
> in the same air you breathe, nothing is simple.*

> *The hair stands up on the back of my neck when I hear ethicists,
> hospital administrators, and politicians, sitting in their safe
> offices, lecture me on my obligation to die providing health- care. We
> don\'t take these risks because of an abstract \"ethical duty\"; we
> take them because it is what we do every time we walk into the chaos
> and danger of the emergency department. We do it because it is our
> job.*

A beautifully written reflection on the academic job market by a scholar
of fairy tales

> *In fairy tales, form is your function and function is your form. If
> you don\'t spin the straw into gold or inherit the kingdom or devour
> all the oxen or find the flour or get the professorship, you drop out
> of the fairy tale, and fall over its edge into an endless, blank
> forest where there is no other function for you, no alternative
> career. The future for the sons who don\'t inherit the kingdom is
> vanishment. What happens when your skills are no longer needed for the
> sake of the fairy tale? A great gust comes and carries you away.*

### *The Jakarta Method,* by Vincent Bevins

I've been following the journalist Vincent Bevins [on
Twitter](https://twitter.com/Vinncent) for a few years now as he\'s
tweeted through progress on his book on the CIA\'s role in the
Indonesian Communist Purge of the 1960s. *The Jakarta Method* is now out
and I\'ve been really surprised at how high-powered the press tour has
been: I did not think the *Times* would ever touch the subject, let
alone give it the frontpage headline [\"The \'Liberal World Order\' Was
Built With
Blood\"](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/29/opinion/sunday/united-states-cold-war.html)
on their international edition. A catch is that it included the line,
*\"No reasonable person denies the great things the United States did in
the 20th century, or that many countries enjoyed prosperity while in
happy alliances with Washington.\"*

In my 13 years in Jakarta, the mass killings of the 1960s were basically
a completely neglected topic in school so this was shamefully
educational for me. [The short version](#0):

> *The \"Jakarta Method\" is rounding up and killing huge numbers of
> unarmed leftists, in the service of establishing a specific type of
> social order. By eliminating these people, this potential opposition,
> you clear the way for authoritarian capitalism at home and the
> creation of a geopolitical actor that fits into a growing, US-led
> system.*

> *The short version is that the US-backed military used a rebellion as
> a pretext to launch a grotesque anti-communist propaganda campaign,
> round up and murder approximately 1 million leftists or accused
> leftists, and put another million in concentration camps...The mass
> slaughter of leftists in Indonesia was more than just another
> Washington-backed atrocity. It was the prototype for smashing the
> hopes and dreams of the Left in the developing world---for good.*

I found Bevins\' excerpt in the [*New York
Review*](https://www.nybooks.com/daily/2020/05/18/how-jakarta-became-the-codeword-for-us-backed-mass-killing/)
to be the best of the many appearances the book\'s made:

*The rank-and-file card-carrying members of the unarmed Communist Party,
who made up a large proportion of the victims, were also entirely
innocent. They didn\'t do anything wrong at all, yet they were condemned
to annihilation, and almost everyone around them was sentenced to a
lifetime of guilt, trauma, and being told they had sinned unforgivably
because of their association with the earnest hopes of left-wing
politics.*

*When the conflict came, and when the opportunity arose, the US
government helped spread the propaganda that made the killing possible
and engaged in constant conversations with the Army to make sure the
military officers had everything they needed, from weapons to kill
lists. The US embassy constantly prodded the military to adopt a
stronger position and take over the government, knowing full well that
the method being employed to make this possible was to round up hundreds
of thousands of people around the country, stab or strangle them, and
throw their corpses into rivers. The Indonesian military officers
understood very well that the more people they killed, the weaker the
left would be, and the happier Washington would be.*

May write more about this once I read my copy.

### [Is it OK to have a child?](https://lrb.co.uk/the-paper/v42/n05/meehan-crist/is-it-ok-to-have-a-child)

A pre-quarantine read I've neglected to post. Meehan Crist\'s essay on
childbearing in the climate change era is as good as everyone was
saying:

> *The polar icecaps are melting. Is it OK to have a child? Australia is
> on fire. Is it OK to have a child? My house is flooded, my crops have
> failed, my community is fleeing. Is it OK to have a child? It is, in a
> sense, an impossible question. With her careful rhetorical shift from
> the intimate \'should I\' to the more theoretical \'Is it OK to still
> have a child?\' Ocasio-Cortez conjured the paradox of scale that
> haunts any consideration of the ethics of childbearing in a time of
> planet-wide catastrophe. Having a child is at once the most intimate,
> irrational thing a person can do, prompted by desires so deep we
> hardly know where to look for their wellsprings, and an unavoidably
> political act that increasingly requires one to confront not only the
> complex biopolitics of pregnancy and birth, but also the intersecting
> legacies of colonialism, racism and patriarchy, all while trying to
> wrap one\'s head around the relationship between the impossible
> extremes of the personal and the global.\"*

Revisiting the essay is also a grim reminder that as recently as
February, it appeared that the Australian wildfires were going to be the
[story of the
year](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/15/world/australia/fires-climate-change.html).
Now it feels like a memory from another lifetime.
