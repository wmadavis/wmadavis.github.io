summary: "There is the matter of Manne's analysis of the 2016 election. The racial dimensions of the election of a billionaire who popularized the Birther movement, ran on a platform explicitly equating Mexicans with rapists, and who labeled Africa a collection of shithole countries are completely absent from Manne's election autopsy. It is completely lost on Manne that the reason the United States does not currently have a female president is because of racism. Is it possible that white women may be active participants and benefactors in the perpetuation of white supremacy (I'm thinking, for example, of the legacy of female participation in slave ownership as documented by the historian Stephanie Jones-Rogers)? In Manne's shockingly aracial analysis of why white women voted for Trump, it does not seem so."

Easiest bits first. There is so much of value in this book. In
particular, Manne's multi-layered formulation of misogyny not as simple
"hatred of women" but as a self-perpetuating system of behavior policing
is convincingly argued and I think should be taught widely. By this, I
mean beyond philosophy including fields such as my own in economics,
which has proved notoriously incapable of incorporating such systemic
phenomena in its analytical frameworks. It is important.\
\
The book is unfortunately very difficult to read. It is an academic book
that the reader will quickly learn is not oriented towards general
audiences. Even as an academic in a field of bad writers and opaque
equations, this was frequently impenetrable and as a result, I took a
break from continuing the book for about seven months. Lots of Goodreads
reviews have voiced this frustration but I particularly relate to one
that singled out the following sentence from page 180:

> *The implicit modus ponens here is too seldom tollensed.*

I involuntarily said, "Oh fuck off" within earshot of a children\'s
playground when parsing that sentence before highlighting it and noting
"wtf" next to it. As someone who went to college intending to major in
philosophy, I get the temptation of verbosity but an editor should have
axed that on sight. The concepts aren't even that difficult to express
in simple writing and frankly, it is a wasted opportunity to invite
marginalized voices to participate in philosophy, a field that like mine
suffers from elitism and a lack of diversity.\
\
Beyond this, it is a bit disorganized; the chapters could be better
distinguished and there are too many large footnotes throughout. The
constant forward and backward references to previous and forthcoming
chapters (e.g. "We will see in Chapter 5 how this manifests\...",
\"recall in Chapter 2 how...\") breaks the flow of an already laborious
read.\
\
The writing isn't bad. The examples provided, drawn from news stories,
literature, movies, and other art, are well chosen. Manne's writing is
very quotable and there are a lot of segments where as a reader you just
think, "I'm familiar with this concept but just hadn't seen it
systematically put into words before." Case in point, a lot of people
engaged enthusiastically with [this tweet of
mine](https://twitter.com/wmdecon/status/1245586853052289024), which was
a literally random sentence from the book (replies seem to be hidden for
some reason). I like in particular the exposition of exonerating
narratives. I\'d recommend [this review of the
book](https://www.lrb.co.uk/the-paper/v41/n05/adam-phillips/unforgiven)---it\'s
what got me to buy it in the first place.

Now, the bad parts and they are indeed very bad. In particular, this
book is deeply irresponsible in its discussions of race and empire.
Manne to her credit begins with a positionality statement acknowledging
her limited vantage point and throughout makes reference to misogynoir
and the privileged status of white women like herself. Nonetheless, the
racial analysis is severely lacking and oftentimes harmfully so,
disappointing in a book that bills itself as intersectional.\
\
The first major stumbling block I identified is from her chapter on
victim-blaming, namely the public's predisposition to not believe the
accounts of victims of misogyny. In it, she considers reasons that would
bring women to make public their grievances in anticipation of
too-common and nonsensical counterarguments that the victim would
somehow benefit from the attention. As the Me Too movement has made
undeniable, this he said/she said battle unfortunately places an unfair
burden of proof on the alleger, who is often a stranger to the public
sphere lacking the resources and benefit of familiarity of their more
powerful, typically male abusers. Manne is convincing in making the
point that if it were the case that the accuser seeks to attract
sympathy, this is a terrible way to do it: the public is primed to
preserve its goodwill towards the familiar and powerful and is prone to
intrusively scrutinizing imperfect victims. The burden of proof is
unbelievably daunting, often humiliating, and evidence is routinely
purposely destroyed. Clearly, no sane person would willingly go through
this ordeal without at least the truth on their side.\
\
Then Manne off-hand (page 238) says that *"given\... the paucity of
analogues running in the other direction, gender-wise"*---meaning given
that we rarely see actual evidence of malevolent accusers---we can
dismiss this motive. This was shocking to read a few days after a
national commemoration of Emmett Till's 79th birthday and during a
moment where video footage keeps surfacing of white women using their
privileged status in attempts to weaponize white supremacy through some
wrongly perceived or outright invented abuse, i.e. "Karens", to use the
ironically now-gentrified nomenclature. Of course, the most high-profile
recent example is that of Amy Cooper calling the police on Christian
Cooper in Central Park. You'll also remember this immediately
recognizable dynamic gives the movie "Get Out" its climax when a police
car finds Daniel Kaluuya's character strangling Allison Williams'
without context. "Who are they gonna believe?" is indeed a weapon and it
is unfair to dismiss that it is wielded by the powerful, who are
sometimes women. Manne's analysis, in my understanding, cannot
accommodate this complication, wherein in white women have repeatedly
been shown to abuse their credibility as victims to threaten the lives
of innocent others. We lament how the Black Lives Matter movement has
been so dependent on fortuitous camera footage to inspire the support of
non-Black people because they face the same unjust burden of proof.
Believe survivors, of course, but where there is intersectional power,
there is complexity beyond what Manne\'s framework permits.\
\
Chapter 8 is mostly a reflection on Hillary Clinton's election loss to
Donald Trump. Like other Goodreads reviewers here, I had followed Manne
on Twitter for a while before getting to this chapter and it is clear
and understandable that she identifies personally with the undeniably
sexist treatment Clinton has received throughout her very public
career.\
\
Unfortunately, the relatability of an objectively qualified and
competent white woman occupying elite space has clearly clouded her
judgment to the point of being unable to consider Clinton's objective
flaws. Chapters earlier, Manne makes the vital point that we cannot hold
victims of misogyny to the impossible standard of being perfect victims.
In fact, she invokes Michael Brown to make this point. Why then does
Manne do Clinton the disservice of making her out as a perfect
politician? Decades as arguably the most powerful woman in the world
straddling neoliberal economics, a racist and punitive war on crime, and
a hawkish war agenda, but Manne will only concede that some unspecified
policies were *"misguided"* without elaboration. When she later
considers Clinton's support of the Iraq War (which she introduces as
Bernie Sanders' *"controversial remarks about Clinton's being
unqualified"*), she does so only to point out that *"Donald Trump's vice
president, Mike Pence, also voted for the war in Iraq"* and that he
received less scrutiny.\
\
Manne also uses this chapter to vaguely highlight the plight of Alice
Goffman, completely omitting the racial-exploitative nature of the
controversy surrounding her. There is probably a sexist component to her
treatment---I was a b-school undergrad not remotely interested in
academia at the time so cannot speak to what the backlash was like---but
the absence of context is odd given Manne's tendency elsewhere to
elaborate on the context behind all her case studies and how they fit
the discussion at-hand. It is also telling that Manne's next book
reportedly will include a chapter on Elizabeth Warren's run in the 2020
Democratic primary. Manne on Twitter has repeatedly and explicitly
rejected the notion that there could be a non-gendered reason for
favoring any candidate besides Warren. I don\'t think I need to appeal
to support of Clinton over Sanders in 2016 and initially Warren over
everyone this cycle (before strongly favoring Sanders) to call this
ridiculously out of touch and reflective of an elitist tunnel vision.
This limited perspective palpable throughout the book contributed to my
hesitation to finish. Even if we were to accept the premise, there is no
good reason to repeatedly narrow your scope of analysis to white, rich,
powerful politicians whose chief downfall is that they've only occupied
the second most powerful political positions in the United States. Julia
Gibbard hardly constitutes diversification. There is a wealth of
material ripe for philosophical analysis outside of the white
Anglosphere.

Finally, there is the matter of Manne's analysis of the 2016 election.
You would not know it from her treatment, but 82% of Black men, 63% of
Latino men, and 61% of non-white others voted for Clinton. Sure, these
are lower than the 94% and 69% of their female counterparts, but Manne's
analysis is so unable to consider non-white agency that one gets the
sense that these facts are mere inconveniences. The racial dimensions of
the election of a billionaire who popularized the Birther movement, ran
on a platform explicitly equating Mexicans with rapists, and who labeled
Africa a collection of shithole countries are completely absent from
Manne's election autopsy.

This isn't to say she does not talk about race in the chapter:

> *My sense is that people in liberal and progressive circles were not
> generally as proud to vote for Clinton as President Obama, despite
> their very similar policies and politics, and the fact that each was
> or would have been (respectively) a history-making president*

Beyond this casual equation of breaking the highest gender and racial
barriers, how deeply must one lose themselves in the professor bubble
that they cannot fathom a non-gendered reason that an upstart Obama
would have an appeal that Clinton did not? It is completely lost on
Manne that, as the numbers above attest, the reason the United States
does not currently have a female president is *because* of racism. Is it
possible that white women may be active participants and benefactors in
the perpetuation of white supremacy (I'm thinking, for example, of the
legacy of female participation in slave ownership as documented by the
historian Stephanie Jones-Rogers)? In Manne's shockingly aracial
analysis of why white women voted for Trump, it does not seem so:

> *It turns out that women penalize highly successful women just as much
> as men do\... In the days following the election, it was common for
> those of us grieving the result to judge the white women who voted for
> Donald Trump even more harshly than their white male counterparts. I
> was guilty of this myself. But\... I subsequently came to redirect a
> good portion of my anger toward the patriarchal system that makes even
> young women believe that they are unlikely to succeed in high-powered,
> male-dominated roles.*

How can one square this takeaway with the voting patterns of non-white
women unless "women" here implicitly means "white women"? Does Manne
suggest *non-white* women think themselves more likely to succeed in
high-powered, male-dominated roles? She refuses to entertain the notion
of white female racism:

> *...almost no black women and relatively few Latina women voted for
> Trump over Clinton. Is racial difference part of what makes for
> psychological self-differentiation from Clinton? Or was the obvious
> fact that these women had more to lose in having a white
> supremacist-friendly president rather an overriding factor in blocking
> the underlying dispositions that might otherwise have been
> operative?\... Whatever the case, it seems plausible that white women
> had additional psychological and social incentives to support Trump
> and forgive him his misogyny\... As white women, we are habitually
> loyal to powerful white men in our vicinity.*

By this account, white women are not racist. No, they are just more
embedded in white culture and thus have a proclivity to forgive while
Black and Latina women are just looking out for what they have to lose.
As for non-white men's overwhelming support for Clinton, it doesn't get
mention at all.

I realize the bulk of this review is negative---it\'s turned out much
longer than I intended---and hones in on one chapter of nine. These
missteps were particularly egregious to me maybe because they spoil what
is otherwise such a valuable offering. I would quite readily recommend
the first seven chapters to anyone with an open mind about dense
writing.\
\
As an aside, this book was my first time reading an excerpt from
then-anonymous Chanel Miller's impact statement in the Brock Turner
case. It's a timeless piece of writing.
