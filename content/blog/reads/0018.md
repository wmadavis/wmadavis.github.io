summary: "San Pedro Sula may not be well known, but from 2011 to 2014 it was the most violent city in the world. The only thing to do there is escape. The crime syndicates, which have complete control over the region and the power of life and death over its people, have in recent years plunged Honduras into an unofficial state of war…. President Trump talks about the migrant caravan as if it were an attempted invasion. In reality, Honduras and Central America have paid an enormous price precisely because of US policies."

Late post because I lost an early draft from two weeks ago. I also
initially had a bullet-point on David Wallace-Wells' climate change book
here but it morphed into its own post, posted just before this one.

### [Coverage of 'the migrant caravan'](https://www.nybooks.com/articles/2019/03/07/migrant-caravan-made-in-usa/)

Why wasn't it covered this way from the beginning:

[CBS also reported last
week](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/thousands-of-migrant-children-were-sexually-abused-in-u-s-custody-hhs-docs-say/?ftag=CNM-00-10aab7e&linkId=64101296)that
4,556 complaints over the past four years alleged unaccompanied migrant
children were sexually abused in US custody

The *New York Review* article makes note of the diminishing numbers at
refugee camps at the border and cite data from Mexican authorities: from
a caravan originally estimated to be about 10,000 strong, 1,300 migrants
returned home, 2,900 received humanitarian visas from Mexico and are
living there legally, and 2,600 were arrested by US Border Patrol for
attempting to cross illegally. The *New York Times* [explored these
migrants' decisions to return to their home countries, attempt an
illegal crossing, or settle in
Mexico](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/16/us/border-migrants-asylum-mexico-aclu.html)
in the face of increasingly stringent policy under President Trump. It
suggests that most of the asylum seekers who have given up on entering
the United States were typically economic migrants who saw opportunity
in joining the Honduran exodus:

> *Mexican officials said the data on people who have deferred or given
> up their quest for asylum in the United States reinforced an idea that
> is often raised by Mr. Trump: that many caravan members are not truly
> desperate for protection.*
>
> *Immigrant advocates said that hype and false promises had attracted a
> group that was somewhat unrepresentative of typical asylum seekers.
> But they pointed to the roughly 4,000 members who had successfully
> entered the United States and had at least requested protected status
> to argue that most had legitimate claims.*
>
> *Michelle Brané, the director of migrant rights and justice at the

> people](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/feb/16/tijuana-migrant-child-murders-mexico-us-asylum?CMP=Share_iOSApp_Other) who

> into the arms of human traffickers, who promise to provide passage
> into the United States.*
>
> *"It may look like it's working in the short term," Ms. Brané said,
> "But I don't think it's a long-term solution. It's driving people
> further into the shadows and that's exactly the opposite of what we

It recalls [this *New Yorker*
article](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2018/01/15/when-deportation-is-a-death-sentence?mbid=social_facebook)
from last year summarizing an outstanding effort by 2016 MacArthur
Fellow Prof. Sarah Stillman and her graduate journalism students at
Columbia to make a record of migrants who were deported to their violent
deaths "with the help of border agents, immigration judges, politicans,
and US voters":

> *Fear of retribution keeps most grieving families from speaking
> publicly. We contacted more than two hundred local legal-aid
> organizations, domestic-violence shelters, and immigrants'-rights
> groups nationwide, as well as migrant shelters, humanitarian
> operations, law offices, and mortuaries across Central America. We
> spoke to families of the deceased. And we gathered the stories of
> immigrants who had endured other harms---including kidnapping,
> extortion, and sexual assault---as a result of deportations under
> Obama and Trump.*

Francisco Cantú, the former Border Patrol guard whose article on border
violence was previously linked to here, [reviews a new
book](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2019/03/11/when-the-frontier-becomes-the-wall)
taking a historical look at the race-based violence and militarism of
[the American frontier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_frontier)
and its modern incarnation in the southern Border Patrol. This is a
history of atrocity---including "*the lynching of thousands of men,
women and children of Mexican descent from the mid-19th century until
well into the 20th century*"---that the *Times* this week reported is
[struggling to be
preserved](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/02/us/porvenir-massacre-texas-mexicans.html).
The book is "The End of the Myth: From the Frontier to the Border Wall
in the Mind of America" by the historian Greg Gandin:

> *Grandin's chapters on the Border Patrol make evident the origins of
> many of today's most egregious border-enforcement practices. When I
> read of the Mexicans who were routinely jeered at by federal agents in
> the 1920s as they crossed the bridge from Ciudad Juárez to El Paso, I
> thought of the agents who mocked a roomful of [crying migrant
> children](https://www.propublica.org/article/children-separated-from-parents-border-patrol-cbp-trump-immigration-policy) last
> summer after they had been separated from their parents. "Aqui tenemos
> una orquesta*," one agent joked---"We've got an orchestra here." When
> I read of the workplace police raids that were conducted in the early
> nineteen-thirties, with the sanction of the Hoover Administration, as
> a "psychological gesture" to scare deportable migrants, I thought of
> the "show me your papers" law, passed in Arizona in 2010 and then
> adopted by other states, with the explicit hope of driving migrants
> toward self-deportation. When I read of the Border Patrol agents who
> admitted to reporters in the nineteen-seventies that, when pursuing
> migrant families, they would often try to apprehend the youngest
> member first, so that the rest would surrender in order to avoid being
> separated, I thought, inevitably, of the enactment last year of "zero
> tolerance," which turned family separation into a national policy.
>
> *Because I served as a Border Patrol agent, from 2008 to 2012,
> Grandin's account brought up more personal memories for me as well.
> Despite its white-supremacist roots, the Border Patrol has evolved
> into an agency where more than half of its members are of Latinx
> descent. Just as the military has long promised social mobility to
> immigrants and minority populations, the Border Patrol provides rare
> access to financial security and the privileges of full citizenship,
> especially for those living in rural border communities. In America,

### *Sabrina*, by Nick Drnaso

Our latest book club venture. [Strong recommendation from *The New
Yorker*](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2019/01/21/the-bleak-brilliance-of-nick-drnasos-graphic-novels)
and I think[the *LA Review* had the best
take](https://lareviewofbooks.org/article/a-humane-remove-nick-drnasos-sabrina/)
on it:

> *At its best, Drnaso's work encourages readers---more thoroughly than
> might art with more explicit rendering of its characters---to
> recognize the interiority of other people. We pause, reflect, and
> introduce more of ourselves.*

As someone unexperienced with graphic novels---I think I've only read
Archie comics, "Watchmen", and a few manga that were popular during high
school---I was surprised by how well Drnaso accomplishes that expression
of interiority through images drawn in the same style as airline
emergency instructions (someone else's comparison that I can't seem to
source at the moment). The illustrations leave a lot more implied that
can text-based novels. Some choice examples with some short commentary:

![](/blog/blog-files/sabrina1.jpeg)

In these two frames, Drnaso can communicate a conversation hitting a
lull without ever saying anything like "An awkward silence ensued."
Previous frames cut back-and-forth between the two characters as they
took turns presenting their ideas so the zoomout brings both into frame
emphasizing the physical presence of the silence. Sabrina's (in blue)
arm position has changed to denote the passage of time.

![](/blog/blog-files/sabrina2.jpeg)

In context, we know exactly what Calvin is telling Teddy here; the exact
grammar of how he phrases it is secondary to what the information means
to Teddy. Teddy in shock collapses into an awkward, painful heap that
would be difficult to describe in words.

![](/blog/blog-files/sabrina3.jpeg)

Exactly what it's like to Facetime a child who's too close to the
camera. The conversation is over as soon as the child goes out of frame
(both of the panel and of Calvin's screen, which are the same
perspective here).

![](/blog/blog-files/sabrina4.jpeg)

Teddy and Calvin are seated together. This page only uses angles
emphasizing Teddy's isolation, obscuring Teddy who's seated right next
to him...

![](/blog/blog-files/sabrina5.jpeg)

...and the next shot is a comically contrasting cut to Calvin's meager
attempt to console him while wearing a Snuggie. The last three frames
here communicate that Teddy has vomited without saying so or using an
over-the-top onomatopoeic "BLEEECCCCHHHHH!!!" Just Calvin dipping his
head slightly in second-hand embarrassment.

### [Jason Hickel vs. Bill Gates/Steven Pinker/Max Roser on the declien of poverty](https://www.jasonhickel.org/blog/2019/2/19/response-to-vox-global-poverty)

The finer points about data quality I don't really care about (though on
that, Branko Milanovic seems to be [by far the most
qualified](https://glineq.blogspot.com/2019/02/global-poverty-over-long-term.html)).
I don't find [this
graph](https://twitter.com/BrankoMilan/status/1103451056934174720) being
celebrated on Twitter particularly compelling. Poverty rates decreasing
across all poverty lines over 25 years---especially these last 25
years---is a very low bar to clear and will be dominantly driven by
[China's market
reforms](https://twitter.com/rodrikdani/status/1104082977934454784).

Lost in this level of aggregation is how many countries for which this
invariance to poverty line does not hold (which I have no clue about but
would like to see). And even in those cases, I'm not sure that's a
meaningful counterfactual upon which to evaluate the successes and
inherent virtues of market fundamentalism.
