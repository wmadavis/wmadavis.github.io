summary: "It has by the fall of 2018 become commonplace to describe the 499 known victims of Larry Nassar as 'breaking their silence,' though in fact they were never, as a group, particularly silent. Over the course of at least 20 years of consistent abuse, women and girls reported to every proximate authority. They told their parents. They told gymnastics coaches, running coaches, softball coaches. They told Michigan State University police and Meridian Township police. They told physicians and psychologists. They told university administrators. They told, repeatedly, USA Gymnastics. They told one another. Athletes were interviewed, reports were written up, charges recommended. The story of Larry Nassar is not a story of silence. The story of Larry Nassar is that of an edifice of trust so resilient, so impermeable to common sense, that it endured for decades against the allegations of so many women."

### The abolition of billionaires

Noticed a funny dichotomy on the frontpage of the international edition
of the Feb. 8 *New York Times*
([pdf](https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/02/08/nytfrontpage/INYT_frontpage_global.20190208.pdf)).
Two above-the-fold headlines on opposite sides: *"It's high time we
abolish billionaires"* on the left and *"Trump casts socialists as
Americans' new threat"* on the right. In between is an article about a
growing trend of labor protests in the country with the second-most
billionaires.

The content of the abolition article is pretty simplistic. Its author
Farhad Manjoo is a veteran tech journalist, which is appropriate enough
given his proximity to Silicon Valley tycoons, but the tech-centricity
of the column maybe blunts the generality of the titular argument. In
order, [the industries that produce the most
billionaires](https://www.forbes.com/sites/omaseddiq/2018/03/10/how-the-worlds-billionaires-got-so-rich/#3dd42eb5124c)
are finance, fashion and retail, real estate, manufacturing, and then
tech. The part questioning the hypocrisy of tolerating "good"
billionaires such as Tom Steyer---who "ticks every liberal box"---is
interesting though. Vox had a [more precise
article](https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2019/2/16/18225498/bill-melinda-gates-annual-letter-2019)
on that topic in the context of the annual Gates letter's recent
publication. I disagree with its central argument.

Nick Gillespie, editor at large for *Reason* magazine, responds in a
blog post titled ["Should Paul McCartney and Other Billionaires Be
'Abolished'?"](http://reason.com/blog/2019/02/07/destroy-all-billionaires)
although the URL says simply "destroy-all-billionaires", which recalls
[this *Silicon Valley*
scene](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9Bg4UU76so). The 'economic'
arguments aren't really worth addressing (the poor have washing
machines), but most of all, I'm tired of libertarians only invoking the
suffering of *"the wretched of the earth"* and *"especially in the
developing world"* when convenient then ignoring their welfare in the
moral calculus of anything else. Gillespie does it twice in that column
when he considers the general improvement in living standards over time
to be a convincing argument for no change.

I found [*Business Insider*'s
offering](https://www.businessinsider.com/abolish-billionaires-inequality-wealth-mainstream-2019-2?r=US&IR=T)
to be better delineated than the *Times* column and much closer to
definitive. They've been surprisingly strong on the topic as part of
their [Better
Capitalism](https://www.businessinsider.com/better-capitalism?r=US&IR=T)
series.

I think it's interesting to think of how distinct this "millennial
socialism" ([*The Economist*'s
term](https://www.economist.com/briefing/2019/02/14/millennial-socialists-want-to-shake-up-the-economy-and-save-the-climate?fsrc=scn/fb/te/bl/ed/millennialsocialistswanttoshakeuptheeconomyandsavetheclimateoutofleftfield&fbclid=IwAR1cuYqTYvDKUzh_dNXWt1gpvqUETrMXJyOPQVuW_t9W3tgPsf_4R92uoL4))
seems to be from Occupy Wall Street. When I was reading Jonathan
Franzen's "Purity" last term, its repeated references to Occupy felt
dated, written when expected it to have more staying power than it
proved to have. I was living in downtown Manhattan attending a business
school at the peak of the movement but still regularly forget it even
happened. Other than the language of percentiles, it seems to have had
disappointingly mild cultural influence.

I'm finding other explanations for the generational shift to be
unconvincing: *The Economist* repeatedly frames it as[ignorance of the
Cold
War](https://www.economist.com/leaders/2019/02/14/millennial-socialism),
others chalk it up to the leadership of Bernie Sanders, Jeremy Corbyn,
Elizabeth Warren, and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. I have some other
ideas---for example, I think it's the inevitable conclusion as soon as
you're convinced that [people shouldn't die of
poorness](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/mother-fights-for-lower-insulin-prices-after-sons-tragic-death/)
or that the prevailing variant of capitalism caused irrevocable climate
change and provides no way out. Does it then follow that the incredible
but less direct threat of climate change is more influential than the
financial crisis in shaping this generation's politics? Or if not
climate change, then what?

I've seen from economists at prominent American universities (Suresh
Naidu, Dani Rodrik, and Gabriel Zucman). Headline: "Economics after
Neoliberalism", a set of essays published in the *Boston Review*
introducing their project, [Economists for Inclusive
Prosperity](https://econfip.org/),
[self-described](https://rodrik.typepad.com/dani_rodriks_weblog/2019/02/economists-for-inclusive-prosperity-efip.html)
as *"a network of academic economists committed to an inclusive economy
and society."* I can't say I really understand what this institution is.

### [Nelson Mandela under incarceration](https://www.nybooks.com/articles/2019/02/07/nelson-mandela-prison-notes-underground/)

A review of his recently published prison letters:

> *Today's familiar figure, enormously self-controlled, morally
> towering, and powerfully eloquent---the man who would ultimately drive
> South Africa's peaceful transition to full democracy---was largely
> shaped during his decades of confinement. Those qualities were forged,
> deepened, or revealed during years of hard labor and deprivation of
> many basic human needs, such as a warm blanket and a mattress. During
> his first several years behind bars on Robben Island, where he would
> remain until he was transferred in 1982, Mandela was assigned a
> so-called D Grade, the lowest classification of South African
> prisoner, with fewer rights and more restrictions than even the most
> violent criminals. He and his codefendants in the trial that had
> resulted in his life sentence were regularly subjected to humiliating
> anal searches in front of other inmates.*

> *This is the picture that emerges with remarkable force from The
> Prison Letters of Nelson Mandela, which draws on hundreds of letters
> to loved ones, friends, and, in surprising numbers, to the authorities
> who confined him... They reveal a man who grew wiser and more
> resourceful behind bars, who developed a monk-like self-awareness and
> stoic discipline, and who became both more strategically astute and
> increasingly generous of spirit toward others, including, ultimately,
> the men who presided over the country's morally repugnant government.*

### *Die, My Love*, Ariana Harwicz (h/t Charlotte)

-   Selection 5 in our college's book club

-   Sam read half of this in its original Spanish. With hateful writing
    this vivid, I wonder what I missed out on, especially after reading
    [this article on the art of
    translation](https://www.nybooks.com/daily/2019/01/21/can-a-translation-be-a-masterpiece-too/)

-   Not a lot of action takes place in this short book (124 pages in my
    copy), but it still felt cinematic throughout---a lot of
    disorientation, mid-paragraph time skips, abrupt metamorphizing into
    natural imagery, implicit perspective changes, and no names. I said
    that if I were a theater actor, this would be great material---I
    found myself having fun just reading some passages out loud while
    reading---and Meredith mentioned Harwicz was previously a
    screenwriter.

-   I think we spent two hours talking about this one and it was
    probably the book that had the most diversity in responses. For
    example, I did not have the sympathetic and feminist reading of the
    violently misanthropic main character that others did.

-   Instead, I kept thinking of "No Children" by The Mountain Goats:

> *And I hope when you think of me years down the line\
> You can't find one good thing to say\
> And I'd hope that if I found the strength to walk out\
> You'd stay the hell out of my way*
>
> *I am drowning\
> There is no sign of land\
> You are coming down with me\
> Hand in unlovable hand*
>
> *And I hope you die\
> I hope we both die*
