### [The asteroid theory of dinosaur extinction](https://www.lrb.co.uk/v41/n01/francis-gooding/what-lives-and-what-dies)

Like everyone, I was aware it was the prevailing explanation but had
always been taught to beware it was unsettled science and never learned
the basis for its favored status. Too interesting that the theory's
originator also contributed to the Manhattan Project and the design of
the nuclear bomb dropped on Nagasaki.

The title of the article derives from the author contemplating the
modern-day relevance of the end-Cretaceous event, whatever it was,
eliminating all dinosaurs but not other animals: *"When there is sudden
global environmental and climate change, what lives and what dies?"* And
before you reject the assumption there, it acknowledges *"the
realisation that birds are dinosaurs is probably the single most
important fact ever discovered by dinosaur palaeontologists."*

Still, there are a small minority of holdouts in the debate, such as
Prof. Gerta Keller of Princeton, who is a proponent of the Deccan Traps
explanation, which attributes dinosaur extinction mostly to a series of
volcanic eruptions in West India. The Atlantic had a lengthy article
last year on the academic debate surrounding the end-Cretaceous event
titled ["The Nastiest Feud in
Science"](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2018/09/dinosaur-extinction-debate/565769/)
featuring some ad hominem attacks and cross-disciplinary antagonism with
dissenters fearing for their careers, which makes the natural and social
sciences seem not so different after all. It's more a fascinating
portrait of academic hostility on an apolitical topic than an
educational one that reliably weighs the balance of evidence, I think. I
myself am partial to this theory:

### [The etymology of narwhals](https://www.lrb.co.uk/v41/n01/katherine-rundell/consider-the-narwhal)

Deeply upsetting to learn that narwhals were

> *named rather ungallantly for the Old Norse word* nar*, meaning
> 'corpse', and* hvalr*, 'whale', after their mottled grey markings.*

Can you imagine discovering a species of literal water unicorns and
decides to name them after their skin blemishes instead of their
absurdly prominent and functionally inexplicable horns?

### [The ghost statistic that haunts women's empowerment](https://www.newyorker.com/science/elements/the-ghost-statistic-that-haunts-womens-empowerment) (h/t Helena)

*The New Yorker* investigates the frequently cited statistic that women
spend 90% of their income on their children, while men spend 30-40%. It
seems an original source can\'t be found.
