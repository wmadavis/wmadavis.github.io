Three comic artists illustrate the Syrian exodus (paywalled):

### Roma (2018), dir. Alfonso Cuarón

-   I attended an advanced screening of what's expected to be a strong
    awards contender. I don't know how autobiographical it is but the
    movie just breathes love and gratitude. Set in 1970s Mexico City,
    its depiction of the relationship between a privileged middle-class
    family and their live-in maid and the contradictions of such a
    relationship I imagine would be resonant with many from the Global
    South.
-   I liked [the Washington Post's
    review](https://www.washingtonpost.com/goingoutguide/movies/no-the-movie-roma-isnt-as-good-as-youve-heard-its-even-better/2018/12/05/480c866c-f592-11e8-bc79-68604ed88993_story.html?utm_term=.e7d52a398ad4)
    but in general the mainstream takes I've come across are bizarrely
    uninteresting. In the face of an obviously intimate film depicting a
    complex familial dynamic, they seem to use technical observations
    (positive or negative) as a crutch for an inability to comment on
    the unfamiliar reality depicted. That's just bad art criticism
    beyond just demographic underrepresentation. It reminds me of when I
    watched Moonlight and the group of friends I went with came out of
    it clearly uncomfortable and unable to offer a positive or negative
    opinion on anything more specific than that they "couldn't relate to
    it." Imposing some standard of relatability is such a restrictive
    and stupid way to experience art to me, it still pisses me just
    thinking about it.
-   That said, credit to [Brooklyn-based
    Remezcla](http://remezcla.com/lists/film/latino-film-critics-review-roma-alfonso-cuaron/)
    for soliciting Latino critics' responses. One recommends the 2015
    film "Que horas ela volta? (The Second Mother)" out of Brazil as a
    more thorough exploration of the maid-family dynamic.

On the topic of domestic staff, recommending some excellent but
heartbreaking reading:

-   [My Family's
    Slave](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2017/06/lolas-story/524490/),
    written by a Filipino Pulitzer Prize winner and published
    posthumously. The article was a very big deal among Filipinos at the
    time.

### [A 2015 history of Brazil](https://www.nybooks.com/articles/2018/12/06/bolsonaro-brazils-brutal-messiah/)

Newly updated and translated to English, rebuts prevailing views that
the slave trade has not left a racist legacy akin to the United States'

### [The development of neural prosthetics](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2018/11/26/how-to-control-a-machine-with-your-brain)

Especially timely for me as someone who recently completed Doc Ock's
storyline on Spider-Man on the PS4. Schwartz's biotech falls short of
Octavius's sentient metallic limbs but to his credit, he better achieves
Octavius's original goal of helping amputees. An engrossing science and
technology story here but the patient, Jan Scheuermann, quickly steals
the show with her personality:

> *"They said, 'You know this includes voluntary brain surgery?' I said,
> 'Yup, that's OK. I'm going to move that robotic arm!' They said,
> 'Well, these two pedestals will stick out of your head, about
> three-quarters of an inch, and it will be that way until we take them
> out.' and I said 'OK, sure. I want to move that robotic arm with my
> mind!'"*

> \*Protruding from the top of her head were the two pedestals:
> cylinders reminiscent of Frankenstein's monster, each the diameter of
> a quarter, and capped to prevent moisture from getting into the
> contact points. Scheuermann vowed to embrace them. She told herself
> they were instruments of exploration, and named them Lewis and
> Clark.\*\*

> *"Then they asked me if I had a goal. I sensed they wanted me to say
> that I wanted to touch my children, or my husband. I said, 'Yeah, I
> have a goal. I want to feed myself chocolate.'"*

> *"I flew a plane today. I freaking flew a plane today! I am 54 years
> old, I've been a quadriplegic for 14 years, and I flew a plane today!
> In my mind, I'm still flying."*

Her quote to end the piece is a tear-jerker. And here's a 60 Minutes
segment on the same patient from five years ago. I admire her commitment
to the Times crossword.
