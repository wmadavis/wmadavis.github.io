### [When the suffrage movement sold out to white supremacy](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/02/opinion/sunday/women-voting-19th-amendment-white-supremacy.html?smid=fb-nytimes&smtyp=cur&fbclid=IwAR2JXMMI9rFBcnpjkQkz4yOhlvcIUyPn_SYg3bPDE0XbgdpHr0FfEIf4UkQ)

-   This was my first time coming across the speech by suffragist and
    writer [Frances Ellen Watkins Harper to the Eleventh National
    Women's Rights Convention in New York on May 1,
    1866](https://awpc.cattcenter.iastate.edu/2017/03/21/we-are-all-bound-up-together-may-1866/):

> *We are all bound up together in one great bundle of humanity, and
> society cannot trample on the weakest and feeblest of its members
> without receiving the curse in its own soul. You tried that in the
> case of the negro. You pressed him down for two centuries; and in so
> doing you crippled the moral strength and paralyzed the spiritual
> energies of the white men of the country. When the hands of the black
> were fettered, white men were deprived of the liberty of speech and
> the freedom of the press. Society cannot afford to neglect the
> enlightenment of any class of its members.*
>
> *...I do not believe that giving the woman the ballot is immediately
> going to cure all the ills of life. I do not believe that white women
> are dew-drops just exhaled from the skies. I think that like men they
> may be divided into three classes, the good, the bad, and the
> indifferent.*
>
> *....Talk of giving women the ballot-box? Go on. It is a normal
> school, and the white women of this country need it. While there
> exists this brutal element in society which tramples upon the feeble
> and treads down the weak, I tell you that if there is any class of
> people who need to be lifted out of their airy nothings and
> selfishness, it is the white women of America.*

I'm disheartened by the defensiveness of the NYT reader comments; there
is value in the type of introspection these challenges evoke. Critically
revisiting our shortcomings and identifying our blind spots are the
purposes of events like Black History Month (this month in the States)
or LGBT month (this month here in the UK). Addressing ongoing struggles
should be uncomfortable; let's not
[sterilize](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/apr/04/martin-luther-king-cornel-west-legacy)
and
[misremember](https://www.thenation.com/article/misremembering-i-have-dream/)
the details for palatability and peace of mind. Sorry if this paragraph
reads as trite, but I've been feeling this a lot lately and wouldn't
mind erring on the side of trite enunciation.

I hold with Wordsonfire from Minneapolis who wrote:

> *I'm struck by all the defensiveness and whataboutism in the responses
> to this column. Cloaking responses in "what was possible at that
> time," and "black men did it too only worse," suggests that it's
> harder to just accept history and those flawed individuals who came
> before us as they were.*
>
> *Few are willing to say what needs to be said: "That was wrong. Let's
> strive to do better."*
>
> *So little was required of the readers of this column and yet they
> were unable to demonstrate even the smallest bit of remorse or
> solidarity with black women.*

### [America, an empire in decline](https://www.nybooks.com/articles/2019/02/07/imperial-exceptionalism/)

It's only mentioned as a supporting example in the article, but the
American occupation of the Philippines tends to be mischaracterized,
especially by younger Filipinos, as one of a benevolent variety despite
its[brutality and
hyper-racialization](https://historynewsnetwork.org/article/26395). This
occupation was the origin of the ["white man's
burden."](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_White_Man's_Burden)
Something on the order of 250,000 Filipinos died, the Philippines'
[culture and institutions were
Americanized](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YupIdd5DMn0), and a very
prevalent [internalization of American
'superiority'](https://www.psychologytoday.com/gb/blog/unseen-and-unheard/201711/filipinos-colonial-mentality-and-mental-health)
persists.\
\
So to relate this back to the thrust of the article, I'd just say I find
its depiction of America as a contradictory nonterritorial empire pretty
convincing. [*Foreign
Policy*](https://foreignpolicy.com/2019/01/30/everything-you-know-about-global-order-is-wrong/)
had a complementary reframing of the postwar world order, though I only
skimmed it.

### [Against 'new optimism](https://www.nybooks.com/articles/2019/02/07/pinker-rosling-progress-accentuate-positive/)'

I find these optimists usually don't define a meaningful counterfactual
and that when they are convincing, the change in perspective is usually
that things were worse before not that things seem better now. In that
framing, new optimism would seem an argument for complacency and usually
a validation of the
([neoliberal](https://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/fandd/2016/06/ostry.htm))
status quo. We don't evaluate, say, civil rights movements this way by
asking oppressed people to be grateful for the gains they've made; we
ask why they couldn't be afforded them sooner and why injustices persist
today:

I wonder what a new-optimist response might be to the finding in
[*Alesina, Stantcheva, and Teso
(2017)*](https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/aer.20162015) that
[*"pessimists [about social mobility] are far more supportive of
redistributive welfare
policies"*](https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2017/01/the-dark-side-of-american-optimism/513680/)
because to me, new optimism comes from a place of privilege. New
optimism feels like an extension of the reactionary denial of the
effectiveness of protest, of labor militancy, of the necessary and
productive violence of anticolonial and antiracist movements around the
world. It's also a paternalistic denunciation of the right of the
disadvantaged to react to their reality, which may indeed be grim. As
Amia Srinivasan has written, sometimes [anger is
apt](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/jopp.12130) and is
self-justifying independent of a condescending consequentialist frame
evaluating how 'productive' it is.

I also haven't seen one meaningfully approach the topic of the coming
[climate refugee crisis that could imperil
billions](http://news.cornell.edu/stories/2017/06/rising-seas-could-result-2-billion-refugees-2100).
But do let me know if you come across a new optimist from a developing
country. Here's [*The Nation* on Steven Pinker's perspective on climate
change](https://www.thenation.com/article/waiting-for-steven-pinkers-enlightenment/):

> *But even if we grant that in many domains human life has indeed
> improved enormously over the past two centuries, there remains a
> simple question: Can we count on the progress continuing? What, for
> instance, about climate change? Pinker is no climate-change denier,
> and admits that "the challenge is daunting." But then he quickly
> pivots from his position that things are getting better and better to
> say that we can avoid the looming doom if only we start taxing carbon
> emissions, increase the use of nuclear power, and engage in deliberate
> climate engineering to lower global temperatures.*
>
> *He largely disregards the fact that the political will to move in any
> of these directions is wholly lacking and will remain so as long as
> the party that controls the White House and Congress refuses to admit
> that a problem even exists. When it comes to his favored technological
> solution, nuclear power, Pinker also seems determined to ignore the
> problem that the people who manage plants do not always follow their
> own safety procedures and cannot plan for every possible natural
> disaster (as Fukushima showed all too dramatically). The industry, he
> insists, has learned from its mistakes.*

### [The 2020 Democratic candidates are sorry](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/03/us/politics/democrats-2020-apologies.html)

### A review of *Bad Blood*, John Carreyrou

I added "Bad Blood," John Carreyrou's book on Theranos to my to-read
list. [This
review](https://www.lrb.co.uk/v41/n03/deborah-friedell/a-chemistry-is-performed)
made it a quick sell. Its title "A chemistry is performed" comes from
this:

> *Until they were ready to go public, Holmes ruled that Theranos was to
> operate in 'stealth mode': no published papers open to peer review, no
> demonstrations to anyone who hadn't signed a non-disclosure agreement.
> All visitors had to be accompanied at all times, even to the loo.
> Holmes's corner office -- modelled on the Oval Office, and with the
> same arrangement of desks, sofas and armchairs -- had windows made
> from bulletproof glass... To reporters, to investors, Holmes would say
> that her technological breakthroughs were a 'trade secret', like the
> recipe for Coca-Cola.*
>
> *...But as for how it all worked, Holmes would only say that 'a
> chemistry is performed so that a chemical reaction occurs and
> generates a signal from the chemical interaction with the sample,
> which is translated into a result, which is then reviewed by certified
> laboratory personnel.'*

So good. There is also a brutal invokation of Paulo Coelho's "The
Alchemist" at the end. [An Adam McKay adaptation of the
book](https://techcrunch.com/2018/11/28/the-inventor-a-documentary-about-theranos-and-the-psychology-of-deception-will-premiere-at-sundance/)
is already in development.

### The music of *If Beale Street Could Talk (2018),*

I was finally able to catch Barry Jenkins' follow-up to *Moonlight*. I'm
still processing my thoughts, but the *music:*

### [Tony Romo\'s sensational color-commentary genius](https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/jan/24/tony-romo-cbs-nfl-analyst-dallas-cowboys)

I don\'t think an NBA player could replicate Romo\'s intuition for
basketball broadcasts---the pace of a football game and the breaks
between plays allowe these types of pre-action analyses and I think
it\'s an analytical skill quarterbacks need to develop much better than
do point guards.

But even if there were, it would go against ESPN and TNT\'s propensities
to promote inane under-informed voices in place of intelligent analysts.
I wasn\'t able to find the tweet I read a while back that bemoaned the
massive gulf in quality of basketball analysis between television
announcers and (a select few) writers and bloggers, but it rings very
true.
