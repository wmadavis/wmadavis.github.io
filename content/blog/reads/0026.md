summary: "The choice of the name 'game theory' was brilliant as a marketing device. I think it’s a very tempting idea for people, that they can take something simple and apply it to situations that are very complicated, like the economic crisis or nuclear deterrence. But this is an illusion. Now my views, I have to say, are extreme compared to many of my colleagues. I believe that game theory is very interesting, I’ve spent a lot of my life thinking about it. But I don’t respect the claims that it has direct applications... If I could repeat my life, I would probably follow my unfulfilled dream to be a lawyer."

As with the last post, these are reads that have accumulated over the
last several months that I'm only just now writing up.

### '[Economists have contributed disturbingly little to discussions about climate change](https://cepr.org/voxeu/columns/why-are-economists-letting-down-world-climate-change)'

Back in September, there was a mid-sized economics Twitter response to
[this article by Andrew Oswald and Nick
Stern](https://voxeu.org/article/why-are-economists-letting-down-world-climate-change)
which criticized the field for its silence on climate change. They
charge that economists have "*contributed disturbingly little to
discussions about climate change*" and *"are failing human civilisation,
including their own grandchildren.*" (See also Stern's more [recent
opinion
piece](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/23/opinion/climate-change-costs.html)
published with Naomi Oreskes)

Particularly provocative was their observation that the *Quarterly
Journal of Economics*, the field's most cited journal, has published
zero articles on climate change *ever*. They and others point out that
[other mainstream journals are not much
better](https://twitter.com/JakeVigdor/status/1174028823064506369).
There was some pushback from agricultural economists who felt their work
was being overlooked in this sweeping indictment of the discipline and
also from economists from other subfields who mined the annals to find
examples of climate-adjacent articles in those journals. On the latter,
I wasn't convinced by any counterexamples that surfaced: there do exist
environmental and energy papers in those journals, but they were not
remotely climate papers. Regardless, the point stands unless you think
the dearth is explained mostly by papers choosing to publish in science
journals for its wide reach and quick turnarounds. Seems unlikely to me.

I side most with Oswald and Stern, though I empathize with the
agricultural economists' grievances (see Dr. Whitehead's embedded tweet
thread). Doing so unfortunately feeds into a view that [economists have
contributed literally nothing to climate
change](https://twitter.com/AndrewDessler/status/1184156188843368448)
understanding, which I vehemently disagree with despite my qualms. This
seems to implicitly equate climate economics with the
unresolved/unresolvable debate over damage discounting and the overly
conservative foundations of ad hoc damage estimation that still haunt
the subfield at large.

I do object to what I see as [overly generous
revisionism](https://twitter.com/wmdecon/status/1175480028282441729) by
economists from other subfields who I think are too proud of the field's
successfully modeling the problem as an externality. That's a low bar to
say the least. It is easy to reach consensus on carbon taxes when you
don't specify what those taxes should look or model its political
economy. On climate, economists have a tendency to view the failure of
an intermediate-economics level theory of carbon taxes as an indictment
of reality, it's so bizarre.

### [Obama's legacy of generational disaffection](https://www.dissentmagazine.org/article/the-obamanauts)

Thought this was terrific and very creatively delivered by way of a
critical review of the various memoirs his staffers have been publishing
(Samantha Power's came too late to be included). Even as someone who
liked Ben Rhodes' memoir, the jabs at the self-presentations of the
"Obamanauts" as plucky [Sorkinesque](#0) underdogs are well-taken and
devastating. Excerpts getting to the heart of the piece:

> *Lincoln, Roosevelt, and Reagan won election by promising to crush a
> systemic social malignancy: the slaveocracy, economic royalists, a
> parasitic class of liberal elites. Unlike these transformative
> presidents of left and right, Obama disavowed any structural
> transformations of society or the economy.*

> *So perhaps Obama's most important legacy will be one of productive
> disappointment: energizing a multiracial coalition of young voters
> whose subsequent disaffections with Obamaism and inclinations toward
> socialism are today remaking the left.*

### [One Summer in America](One%20Summer%20in%20America)

Can't read this recapping this past Summer 2019 in American news without
some horror at how we just... move on. Second or third *LRB* article
I've come across to use this patchwork style of news commentary and it's
devastatingly effective each time. Even in writing this blog post, I'm
revisiting articles I read one or two months ago that alarmed me at the
time before just being forgotten.

### ['At the Times, a Hesitance to Hyperlink'](https://www.vice.com/en/article/ywaeg5/at-the-times-a-hesitance-to-hyperlink)

A+ title, I had to co-opt it.

> *This week it was [*Slate*](https://slate.com/technology/2019/09/kickstarter-turmoil-union-drive-historic-tech-industry.html) (and [*BuzzFeed*](https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/leticiamiranda/amazon-orthodox-jews)); at other times it's been [*the Guardian*](https://twitter.com/stuartmillar159/status/1184512744101425157) and [*Gawker*](https://www.niemanlab.org/2015/07/why-dont-the-new-york-times-and-other-news-organizations-link-out-to-sources-more-often/); several [times](https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/xwk9zd/how-facebook-content-moderation-works), it's been [*VICE*](https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/gy774j/a-fake-nude-of-alexandria-ocasio-cortez-was-debunked-by-foot-fetishists). It goes on and on, with the *Times* running stories that other people already have and not acknowledging them for seemingly no better reason than the paper's institutional belief that a thing does not exist until the paper has deemed it noteworthy.*
>
> *Some reporters and editors at the paper say that individual instances
> of not properly crediting are attributable not to a policy of not
> linking to rival news outlets, but just to harried journalists not
> getting around to doing so, green reporters not knowing to do so, and
> editors not being aware of previous reporting and not doing the
> research needed to add links. Others just throw their hands up.*
>
> *'I wish you great luck,' a current *Times* employee said, 'in shaming people out of this policy.'*

Reporter April Glaser:

> *I don't know what I'm doing wrong. I worked hard to break the Kickstarter Union story and gain the trust of sources. Why won't the NYT or WaPo cite who broke it? This is my career.*

### [What if your abusive husband is a cop?](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2019/10/07/what-if-your-abusive-husband-is-a-cop)

> *In the nineteen-nineties, researchers found that forty-one per cent
> of male officers admitted that, in the previous year, they'd been
> physically aggressive toward their spouses, and nearly ten per cent
> acknowledged choking, strangling, or using---or threatening to use---a
> knife or a gun. But there are almost no empirical studies examining
> the prevalence of this sort of abuse today.*
>
> *This year, an independent panel found that the typical penalty for
> New York City police officers found guilty of domestic violence---some
> had punched, kicked, choked, or threatened their victims with
> guns---was [thirty lost vacation
> days](https://www1.nyc.gov/assets/ccpc/downloads/pdf/The-NYPDs-Disciplinary-System-How-Who-Engage-in-Serious-Off-Duty-Misconduct-August-1998.pdf).
> In nearly a third of cases, the officers already had a
> domestic-violence incident---and, in one case, eight---in their
> records. In the Puerto Rico Police Department, ninety-eight police
> officers were arrested for domestic violence between 2007 and 2010;
> three of them had shot and killed their wives. Only eight were fired.*

### [Ariel Rubinstein on game theory](https://fivebooks.com/best-books/ariel-rubinstein-on-game-theory/) (h/t Tim)

> **Q*: Looking at the flipside, was there ever a situation in which you

>
> **AR***: None. Not only none, but my point would be that categorically

> there was a programme on CBS, called Numbers, written 'Numb3rs', with
> the 'e' reversed\... But outside such programmes, I categorically
> cannot see any case where game theory could be helpful.*

> *The choice of the name "theory of games" was brilliant as a marketing

### [An interview of physicist Chanda Prescod-Weinstein](https://www.publicbooks.org/public-thinker-chanda-prescod-weinstein-on-dark-matter-and-white-empiricism)

### *Parasite (2019)*, dir. Bong Joon-ho

My favorite movie of the year so far and by a large margin. The *New
York Times* had four articles on the movie in October alone, [the last
one](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/30/movies/bong-joon-ho-parasite.html)
effusive to an OTT degree:

> *"What makes Parasite the movie of the year---what might make Bong the
> filmmaker of the century---is the way it succeeds in being at once
> fantastical and true to life."*

Thematically and visually, this succeeds in all the ways I thought *Us
(2019)* far undershot its ambitions. It's also hilarious. Don't read
anything else about it if you can watch it.
