description: "ECON-UN3412 introduces students to multiple regression and related methods for analyzing data in economics and related disciplines. Additional topics include regression with discrete random variables, instrumental variables regression, analysis of random experiments and quasi-experiments, and regression with time series data. Students will learn how to conduct – and how to critique – empirical studies in economics and related fields. Accordingly, the emphasis of the course is on empirical applications."

## Heading test

This course covers research topics related to unemployment. It discusses models used to describe unemployment, and policies used to tackle unemployment. It tries to answer several questions: 

+ Bullet point style 1
+ Bullet point style 1
+ Bullet point style 1
+ Bullet point style 1

2. [Absence of unemployment in the competitive model](https://youtu.be/aGPtfVEUO2o)

##### Introductory readings

+ [Darity, Goldsmith (1996)](https://doi.org/10.1257/jep.10.1.121) –  This survey reviews the social-psychological consequences of unemployment. It finds that exposure to unemployment severely damages psychological health.
+ [Di Tella, MacCulloch, Oswald (2003)](https://doi.org/10.1162/003465303772815745) – This paper finds in well-being surveys that unemployment make people unhappy. Being unemployed makes you unhappy, and having unemployment in your country makes you unhappy. In fact, they find after controlling for income and other personal characteristics that becoming unemployed is as painful as divorcing.

## Labor market facts and matching function

This section reviews basic facts about the labor market and unemployment in the United States. We then introduce the matching function—the main tool that we will use to model the labor market and unemployment. The matching function summarizes the complex process through which workers searching for jobs and firms searching for employees meet each other.

+ [Shimer (2012)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.red.2012.02.001) – This paper shows that in the United States, unemployment fluctuations are caused by fluctuations in the job-finding rate and not fluctuations in the job-separation rate.
+ [Petrongolo, Pissarides (2001)](https://doi.org/10.1257/jel.39.2.390) – This survey reviews the microfoundations of the matching function, its empirical properties, and its applications.

## Matching model of the labor market

This section introduces the matching model of the labor market. This is the model that we will use to study unemployment and labor market policies in this course. The model was developed by Peter Diamond, Dale Mortensen, and Christopher Pissarides in the 1980s—for this they received a Nobel Prize in 2010. In the matching model, unlike in the neoclassical model, all trades are mediated by a matching function. Nevertheless, we can construct labor supply and labor demand curves, and use them to solve the matching model.
