## ECON-GU4999: Senior Seminars (Fall 2023, Spring 2024)

##### Course description

The honors thesis seminar is a year-long course, beginning in the fall semester and ending in the spring semester. This workshop may only be taken by students applying for departmental honors, and it also fulfills the economics seminar requirement for the economics major and all joint majors. Students must see the director during mid-semester registration in the spring to discuss their proposed thesis topic, at which time they will be matched with appropriate faculty who will act as their thesis adviser. Students will meet their adviser over the course of the year at mutually agreed upon times. A rough draft of the thesis will be due during the first week of February in the spring semester, and the final draft will be due three weeks before the last day of classes. Please note that for those joint majors that require two seminars, one in economics and one in the other discipline (i.e. Political Science), the economics senior honors thesis seminar only fulfills the economics seminar requirement.

## ECON-UN3412: Introduction to Econometrics (Fall 2020, Spring 2021, Fall 2021, Summer 2023)

##### Course description

"ECON-UN3412 introduces students to multiple regression and related methods for analyzing data in economics and related disciplines. Additional topics include regression with discrete random variables, instrumental variables regression, analysis of random experiments and quasi-experiments, and regression with time series data. Students will learn how to conduct – and how to critique – empirical studies in economics and related fields. Accordingly, the emphasis of the course is on empirical applications."

##### Course description

The purpose of this course is to offer a solid, intermediate-level training in theoretical microeconomics. We will try to achieve a more in-depth understanding of how the standard theoretical models of microeconomics work. The course consists of three parts. We will start out by analyzing consumer decision-making. We then turn to the behavior of firms. Finally, the third part of the course studies the interaction of consumers and firms in goods markets.

## ECON-UN2257: The Global Economy (Spring 2023)

##### Course description

This course is designed for students who are not intending to major in Economics but are interested in important global, economic issues. The course will focus on current events and the increasing international interdependence of the world economy, and will also include historical examples, data, and theoretical frameworks helpful for understanding international economics. A number of areas within international economics will be covered:
(i) why countries trade, what goods and services will be traded, how the gains from trade are distributed and the tools of commercial policy;
(ii) the movement of labor and capital across borders; value of transnational countries and production processes across countries;
(iii) international finance issues including exchange rates, balance of payments and open economy macroeconomic adjustment.
As the countries of the world have become increasingly interconnected, we have seen how isolated events in one country quickly spiral into global events that have an economic impact on all individuals, e.g., Covid-19 Pandemic, Tariff Wars between US and China, War between Russia and Ukraine. These events are happening with relatively greater frequency and as citizens we are more rapidly aware of the circumstances given global news coverage.
