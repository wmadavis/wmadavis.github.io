Using this space, as well my Github, to share some of the resources I’ve prepared during my teaching career at Columbia. I’ve also seen some of my material paywalled on Course Hero so please just take it from here for free.

I cannot guarantee a response but feel free to email clarifying questions about any of this material. Video recordings available upon request to those looking to follow along at their own pace or supplement their own studies, especially those from developing countries. Any errors are due to the professors who taught me wrong or the students who didn’t point them out.

Current or former students can use their Columbia email to book office hours [here](https://calendly.com/wmadavis/)
