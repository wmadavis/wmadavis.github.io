title: "Teaching"

Using this space, as well my Github, to share some of the resources I’ve prepared during my teaching career at Columbia. I’ve also seen some of my material paywalled on Course Hero so please just take it from here for free. Any errors are due to the professors who taught me wrong or the students who didn’t point them out.

Current or former students may use their Columbia email to book office hours [here](https://calendly.com/wmadavis/)
