title: "Teaching"

Using this space to share some of the resources (coming soon) I’ve prepared during my teaching career at Columbia. I’ve seen some of my material paywalled on Course Hero so please just take it from here for free. Any errors are due to the professors who taught me wrong or the students who didn’t point them out.

Current students may use their Columbia email address to book office hours [here](https://calendly.com/wmadavis/).
