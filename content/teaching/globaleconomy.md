summary: "This course is designed for students who are not intending to major in Economics but are interested in important global, economic issues. The course will focus on current events and the increasing international interdependence of the world economy, and will also include historical examples, data, and theoretical frameworks helpful for understanding international economics. A number of areas within international economics will be covered: (i) why countries trade, what goods and services will be traded, how the gains from trade are distributed and the tools of commercial policy; (ii) the movement of labor and capital across borders; value of transnational countries and production processes across countries; (iii) international finance issues including exchange rates, balance of payments and open economy macroeconomic adjustment. As the countries of the world have become increasingly interconnected, we have seen how isolated events in one country quickly spiral into global events that have an economic impact on all individuals, e.g., Covid-19 Pandemic, Tariff Wars between US and China, War between Russia and Ukraine. These events are happening with relatively greater frequency and as citizens we are more rapidly aware of the circumstances given global news coverage."

## Course description

This course is designed for students who are not intending to major in Economics but are interested in important global, economic issues. The course will focus on current events and the increasing international interdependence of the world economy, and will also include historical examples, data, and theoretical frameworks helpful for understanding international economics. A number of areas within international economics will be covered: (i) why countries trade, what goods and services will be traded, how the gains from trade are distributed and the tools of commercial policy; (ii) the movement of labor and capital across borders; value of transnational countries and production processes across countries; (iii) international finance issues including exchange rates, balance of payments and open economy macroeconomic adjustment. As the countries of the world have become increasingly interconnected, we have seen how isolated events in one country quickly spiral into global events that have an economic impact on all individuals, e.g., Covid-19 Pandemic, Tariff Wars between US and China, War between Russia and Ukraine. These events are happening with relatively greater frequency and as citizens we are more rapidly aware of the circumstances given global news coverage.
