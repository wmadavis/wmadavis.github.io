#### ["I think I would like to call myself 'The girl who wanted to be God'": the life of Sylvia Plath (h/t Other Matt)](https://www.lrb.co.uk/the-paper/v40/n24/joanna-biggs/i-m-an-intelligence)

+ That's 'life' as in fervor not biography.

> There is a greediness to all this, a relentlessness, a desire to have it all. But only men can have it all, she wrote in her journal:
>
> > My consuming desire to mingle with road crews, sailors and soldiers, bar room regulars – to be part of a scene, anonymous, listening, recording – all is spoiled by the fact that I am a girl, a female always in danger of assault and battery ... I want to talk to talk to everybody I can as deeply as I can. I want to be able to sleep in an open field, to travel west, to walk freely at night.

> At 17, she had told her journal: ‘I think I would like to call myself “The girl who wanted to be God”.’ And she would retain this intensity across her whole career. 

#### ["Jeremiah Wright knew what America was becoming. The Obamas can’t see what it is."](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/michelle-obama-jeremiah-wright_us_5c182d2fe4b08db99056c8a7?ck)

#### 'This is Going to Hurt', Adam Kay (h/t Helena)

Immersive and powerful read that contains a common-sense appeal to protect socialized healthcare made all the more convincing by its brevity.

I was moved to talk to my dad today about healthcare, which hasn’t really factored into our lives largely due to good fortune health-wise but also coming from not having a national health program to speak of and living in areas with sketchy quality of service. I’ve lived in the West for the past almost-eight years and have only seen a doctor once and even then only under the insistence of a supervisor. Most of my European friends, who aren’t to my knowledge any less healthy than me, all seem to make a habit of going multiple times a year. To me, this speaks to a cultural adjustment that, against my own interests, I still have not learned to make. From my perspective, the American philosophical resistance to universal coverage comes across as a shocking squandering of opportunity and morally criminal neglect of their most vulnerable; if affordable, insuring against illness and injury has to be like a top-three reason to even have a government.

Side note: I generally dislike books that pack punchlines this densely, but this was fun to read. I still found myself impatiently yearning for the earnest bits so maybe too many anecdotes and footnotes for my personal taste. Must be something about the book as a medium for comedy because dumb tweets like [this](https://twitter.com/KeetPotato/status/823848392027701249) can make me cry.

#### [Avril Lavigne's debut album "Let Go" 16 years later](https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/avril-lavigne-let-go/)

> *Let Go is the foundation of her surprisingly considerable legacy. Her feelings about it might be, well, complicated: She’d grown up enough by its release to know it wasn’t the album she wanted to make, and she never quite escaped its shadow. But you can imagine her listening to Let Go like she’s flipping through a yearbook or watching some long-forgotten DVD from a high-school talent show. It feels like a true dispatch from the frontlines of a teenager’s brain: unsure of itself, inelegant and occasionally inane, crackling with nervous energy.*

Contains this description of “Sk8er Boi”: *"It sounds like Taylor Swift’s 'You Belong With Me' as if written by a normal teenager instead of a precocious musical cyborg."*

#### How pop culture has depicted 9/11

A two-part series:

TL;DW:

> *"Awkwardly, for the most part."*

Terrifically researched, edited, and narrated. The channel is full of high-effort material and is sponsored by [a Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/loosecanon). She has a really convincing takedown of Disney's Hercules on her channel.

#### [Young researchers are much, much more transparent custodians of data](https://www.cell.com/trends/ecology-evolution/fulltext/S0169-5347(18)30281-7)

> *A request for raw data from the corresponding authors of 771 animal biotelemetry-focused manuscripts, published between 1995 and 2015, highlighted a difference in data sharing practices across researcher career levels. Responses were positive in only 11% of requests made to corresponding authors that were senior researchers, while 72% of responses were positive when CAs were early career researchers.*

#### [Management consulting firms employ around 10% of the Ivy League’s graduating classes, usually by appealing to young people’s idealism](https://yaledailynews.com/blog/2011/09/30/even-artichokes-have-doubts/).

> *“I guess the appeal of that kind of job is more in personal development than in any content area. It’s appealing because it seems challenging and because it involves interaction with smart and talented people. There are also some transferable skills [but] I couldn’t imagine myself doing something outside the content area that I care about for more than a few years. Consulting firms do a great job of convincing us that we still have many options open. I think it’s a combination of that and prestige,” he added.*

Can't get the phrase "content area" out of my head.

> *One senior who interned with J.P. Morgan (and who requested anonymity) had a very different experience with the bank.*
> 
> *“Working there was a combination of the least fulfilling, least interesting and least educational experiences of my life. I guess I did learn something, but I learned it in the first two days and could have stopped my internship then. In the next two months I learned nothing but still came into work early and for some reason had to stay until ten,” he said. “I would see these people who loved it but honestly it seemed like they were either uninteresting or lying to themselves.”*

> *“As for the argument that consulting provides an extraordinary skill set with which one can eventually change the world, I just don’t buy it,” he said. “Everyone knows what the skill set is for most entry-level consultants: PowerPoint and Excel.” He sees a huge problem with the idea that consulting and finance are good ways to prepare oneself for a career elsewhere.*
> 
> *“Most firms are looking for people who will stay up until 3 a.m. seven nights a week making slides for a partner who goes home to Wellesley for dinner every night at 5 p.m. — and who will do so thinking that they’re ‘winning.’ Look at it this way: most firms assume that you’ll leave for law school or business school within three years, and they invest in your training accordingly. Quality mentoring when you’re young is worth whatever you pay for it. Sometimes that means less money, sometimes that means less of a life beyond work. But quality mentoring is not going to be delivered by someone who is 26, and just one tidal cycle ahead of you.”*
