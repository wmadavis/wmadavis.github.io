description: "This paper develops a New Keynesian model in which the government multiplier doubles when the unemployment rate rises from 5% to 8%." 
summary: "We train a convolutional neural network to identify low-level features of image data useful for classification tasks. We then assign the CNN the related task of condensing high-resolution daytime satellite images into lower-dimensional vectors of features covariant with the areas’ corresponding night-time luminosities, which we consider imperfect proxies for levels of economic activity. Ridge regression models then relate these feature vectors to data from representative household surveys conducted in Uganda, Tanzania, Nigeria, Malawi, and Rwanda to generate fine-scale “poverty maps”, regionally disaggregated estimates of the distribution of consumption expenditure and asset wealth. Cross-validation analyses show that our transfer learning method compares favorably to existing and expensive methods at out-of-sample prediction, suggesting potential applications for interventions targeting poverty in data-scarce areas. We emphasize our pipeline uses only public data and software, enabling cheap replication and potential scalability to help address the infrequency and prohibitive expense of household surveys."

##### Abstract

Reliable data on economic livelihoods remain scarce in the developing world, hampering efforts to study these outcomes and to design policies that improve them. Here we demonstrate an accurate, inexpensive, and scalable method for estimating consumption expenditure and asset wealth from high-resolution satellite imagery. Using survey and satellite data from five African countries—Nigeria, Tanzania, Uganda, Malawi, and Rwanda—we show how a convolutional neural network can be trained to identify image features that can explain up to 75% of the variation in local-level economic outcomes. Our method, which requires only publicly available data, could transform efforts to track and target poverty in developing countries. It also demonstrates how powerful machine learning techniques can be applied in a setting with limited training data, suggesting broad potential application across many scientific domains.
