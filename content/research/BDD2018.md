##### Summary

We present an empirical framework for evaluating the economic benefits of the 2015 Paris Agreement’s temperature targets of 1.5°C and 2.0°. Our findings decompose the large uncertainties involved in such projection exercises and stress the inequity in impacts: it is a stark result that poorer countries that have historically contributed least to carbon emissions have the most the gain from mitigation of global warming.
