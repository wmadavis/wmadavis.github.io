*Using this space to collate grad-school advisory resources I’ve personally found the most constructive. I make this qualification because plenty of advice I’ve seen widely circulated over the years absolutely would not work for me: my advice for reading advice is to feel emboldened to reject it.*

### Academic advice

+ A guide to full-time research assistant positions (jobs now called “pre-docs”) as a stepping stone to quantitative social-science PhDs: what they are, how to land them, and how to do well in them ([Coly Elhai, Quan Le, Kai Matheson, and Carolyn Tsao](https://raguide.github.io/))
+ A short reflection on not getting into any PhD programs, informed by my experience blanking the first time I applied in 2017
+ Many people find the first year of the PhD brutal, especially those in programs like mine that may cut some students based on their coursework performance. Here’s a short post on my take written after passing.
+ The transition from coursework to research ([Paul Niehaus](https://medium.com/@paul.niehaus/doing-research-18cb310529e0))
> “An alternative way to create structure is to focus on your system. By system I mean the habits and routines you develop and practice on a regular basis. For example, attending the seminar each week, writing down three suggestions for ways to improve the paper, and meeting afterwards with a classmate to discuss your ideas is a practice you might incorporate into your system. In designing your system, your aim is to give yourself a high probability of eventually accomplishing your ultimate goal (come up with a great job market paper) even though you cannot predict with any certainty the sequence of events through which this will come about.”
+ How to find research ideas, among other valuable “hidden curriculum” insights on topics such as co-authoring and choosing journals to submit to ([Susan Athey interviewed by Simon Bowmaker](https://static1.squarespace.com/static/56ec62678a65e20b89da5f33/t/5f481c378f691221f1a3fda8/1598561335875/athey.pdf),  pp. 6-8)
> **“My econometric theory was very similar. I’d be working on an empirical paper, and I’d say, “How can I think about the conditions under which this empirical approach would work?” And I would read papers with informal descriptions of the reasoning, and I would be dissatisfied. And so I would say, “Let me write this down, and if I do it formally, maybe then I’ll understand.” As I started writing things down, I would realize that there was a deeper, more general idea. And I felt that other people would benefit from having that clarity of conceptual insights in their own empirical work, and so I wrote it into econometric theory papers. Almost all of my very theoretical papers have been motivated by trying to solve an applied theory problem, and realizing that I would have more clarity about the specific problem if I understood the generality.”**
+ Most academics largely taught themselves how to code. Some tips here specific to R on remedying bad practices they probably picked up by doing so. ([Jennifer Bryan and Jim Hester](https://rstats.wtf/project-oriented-workflow.html), particularly Sections 2 and 3 on project-oriented workflows)
+ Anatomy of an applied micro talk ([Jesse Shapiro](https://scholar.harvard.edu/files/shapiro/files/applied_micro_slides.pdf))
+ A style guide for mathematical writing ([Donald E. Knuth, Tracy Larrabee, and Paul M. Roberts](https://jmlr.csail.mit.edu/reviewing-papers/knuth_mathematical_writing.pdf), particularly Section 1)
+ How to critique academic work, helpful for referee reports and seminar discussion ([Macartan Humphreys](https://macartan.github.io/teaching/how-to-critique))
+ How to build an economic model in your spare time ([Hal Varian](https://people.ischool.berkeley.edu/~hal/Papers/how.pdf))

### Graduate coursework notes

(working links coming eventually)

**An incomplete archive of notes of variable quality from the two graduate schools I’ve attended. I may scan and upload my handwritten notes once I can regain access to them. The gold standard is still [Luke Stein’s first-year notes from the Stanford core sequence](https://faculty.babson.edu/lcdstein/steincoresummary.pdf).**

#### Columbia PhD (Year 1)

+ **Econometrics I, Part II**: Asymptotic theory, restricted estimation, and resampling
+ **Econometrics II, Part II**: Resampling, multiple testing, quantile regression, non-parametrics, and treatment effects
+ **Macroeconomics I, Part I** (incomplete summary): Introduction to growth theory
+ **Macroeconomics I, Part II**: General equilibrium theory, real business cycles, and an introduction to macro-finance

#### Oxford MPhil (Year 2)

+ **Advanced Microeconomics**: Contracts under information asymmetries, bargaining, and theories of the firm. Notes make reference to figures that are handwritten and not included
+ **Political Economy of Development**:  Literature review: culture and institutions, political reform and political failure, corruption, and conflict
+ **Applied microeconomics**: production function estimation (incomplete short summary), problems and accounting

#### Oxford MPhil (Year 1)

+ **Macroeconomics**: Qualitative summary of the entire year of material: neoclassical growth theory, macro-finance, monetary economics, macroeconomic policy
+ **Macro-finance**: consumption CAPM, exotic preferences, disaster risk, evidence on financial crises, financial frictions, the Great Recession, liquidity, quantitative easing, and financial bubbles

### Economics writing I like

+ [*Political economics and possibilism*](https://academic.oup.com/princeton-scholarship-online/book/18029/chapter-abstract/175891463?login=false&redirectedFrom=fulltext), a 1971 essay by Albert Hirschman on the absence of politics in economists’ analysis
+ [*Economics with a Moral Compass? Welfare Economics: Past, Present, and Future*](https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/abs/10.1146/annurev-economics-020520-020136), a conversation between Amartya Sen, Angus Deaton, and Tim Besley. Video link [here](https://vimeo.com/440032447)
+ [*How should we m easure racial discrimination?*](https://www.phenomenalworld.org/analysis/direct-effects/), an essay by Lily Hu on the pitfalls of causal inference tools for identifying discrimination
