*Using this space to collate academic resources I’ve personally found the most constructive. I make this qualification because plenty of advice I’ve seen widely circulated over the years absolutely would not work for me: my advice for reading advice is to feel emboldened to reject it. Resources for specific courses I've taught or have taken are found in the [Teaching](/teaching/) page.*

### Academic advice

#### Skill development

+ Most academics largely taught themselves how to code. Some tips here specific to R on remedying bad practices they probably picked up by doing so. ([Jennifer Bryan and Jim Hester](https://rstats.wtf/project-oriented-workflow.html), particularly Sections 2 and 3 on project-oriented workflows)
+ Anatomy of an applied micro talk ([Jesse Shapiro](https://scholar.harvard.edu/files/shapiro/files/applied_micro_slides.pdf))
+ A style guide for mathematical writing ([Donald E. Knuth, Tracy Larrabee, and Paul M. Roberts](https://jmlr.csail.mit.edu/reviewing-papers/knuth_mathematical_writing.pdf), particularly Section 1)
+ How to critique academic work, helpful for referee reports and seminar discussion ([Macartan Humphreys](https://macartan.github.io/teaching/how-to-critique))
+ How to build an economic model in your spare time ([Hal Varian](https://people.ischool.berkeley.edu/~hal/Papers/how.pdf))

#### Research

The transition from coursework to research ([Paul Niehaus](https://medium.com/@paul.niehaus/doing-research-18cb310529e0))

> *“An alternative way to create structure is to focus on your system. By system I mean the habits and routines you develop and practice on a regular basis. For example, attending the seminar each week, writing down three suggestions for ways to improve the paper, and meeting afterwards with a classmate to discuss your ideas is a practice you might incorporate into your system. In designing your system, your aim is to give yourself a high probability of eventually accomplishing your ultimate goal (come up with a great job market paper) even though you cannot predict with any certainty the sequence of events through which this will come about.”*

How to find research ideas, among other valuable insights on topics such as co-authoring and choosing journals to submit to ([Susan Athey interviewed by Simon Bowmaker](https://static1.squarespace.com/static/56ec62678a65e20b89da5f33/t/5f481c378f691221f1a3fda8/1598561335875/athey.pdf), pp. 6-8)

> *“My econometric theory was very similar. I’d be working on an empirical paper, and I’d say, “How can I think about the conditions under which this empirical approach would work?” And I would read papers with informal descriptions of the reasoning, and I would be dissatisfied. And so I would say, “Let me write this down, and if I do it formally, maybe then I’ll understand.” As I started writing things down, I would realize that there was a deeper, more general idea. And I felt that other people would benefit from having that clarity of conceptual insights in their own empirical work, and so I wrote it into econometric theory papers. Almost all of my very theoretical papers have been motivated by trying to solve an applied theory problem, and realizing that I would have more clarity about the specific problem if I understood the generality.”*

#### Career

+ A guide to full-time research assistant positions (jobs now called “pre-docs”) as a stepping stone to quantitative social-science PhDs ([Coly Elhai, Quan Le, Kai Matheson, and Carolyn Tsao](https://raguide.github.io/))
+ A short reflection on not getting into any PhD programs, informed by my experience blanking the first time I applied in 2017 (link coming soon)
+ Many people find the first year of the PhD brutal, especially those in programs like mine that may cut some students based on their coursework performance. Here’s a short post on my take written after passing. (link coming soon)

### Economics writing I like

#### [Political economics and possibilism](https://academic.oup.com/princeton-scholarship-online/book/18029/chapter-abstract/175891463?login=false&redirectedFrom=fulltext)

A 1971 essay by Albert Hirschman on the absence of politics in economists’ analysis:

> *Economists continue to identify scientific progress with the elimination of ‘exogenous’ forces from their constructs... Speculation about connections between economics and politics becomes much more profitable when one focuses not on the roughest outline, but on the finer features of the economic landscape. This can of course best be done by the economist who knows about them; the trouble is that his professional interests do not ordinarily lie in this direction. At the same time, the political scientist who has the motivation to look for such connections lacks the familiarity with economic concepts and relationships that is required. Hence the field is happily left to a few mavericks like myself.*


#### [Economics with a Moral Compass? Welfare Economics: Past, Present, and Future](https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/abs/10.1146/annurev-economics-020520-020136)

A conversation between Amartya Sen, Angus Deaton, and Tim Besley. Video link [here](https://vimeo.com/440032447).

> **Deaton**: *"There was a lot of thriving discussion between economics and philosophy. Welfare economics seemed to have some chance of coming back, but if you look at where we are now, most economic departments—including top departments—have no teaching of welfare economics. That subject has just completely vanished. On the other hand, you’ve got practical philosophers who are doing economics without knowing any economics, which can be problematic—sometimes even a disaster. Economists have this sort of bastard idea of welfare economics, or of human well-being, which is not thought out at all. Are you disappointed in this? When you started out, it looked like there would be a different future. What happened, and what needs to be done now to get us back in a better place?"*  

**Sen**: *"I think economists tend to ignore philosophy in general, but the idea of welfare in particular. I think the best article on that sad neglect is Tony Atkinson’s The Strange Disappearance of Welfare Economics."*  

**Deaton**: *"Pleading to bring it back. It’s one of the last pieces he wrote, and it bemoans the loss of any sort of philosophical sophistication. Most economists wouldn’t know what utilitarianism meant. Even elementary stuff has just vanished. Certainly he was bemoaning that."*


### [How should we measure racial discrimination?](https://www.phenomenalworld.org/analysis/direct-effects/)

An essay by Lily Hu on the pitfalls of causal inference tools for identifying discrimination:

> *"But the dominant methodology rests on logic that does not work. No amount of meticulous experimental set-up and statistical practice can rescue quantitative social scientists from needing to make assumptions that amount to substantive claims about what race as a social category is and consequently what racial discrimination as a distinctive moral and legal wrong is. Any distinction between “direct” and “indirect” causal effects of race is inherently ambiguous, unless it is accompanied by answers to such basic theoretical and normative questions. This error of ambiguity lies at the core of causal interpretations of racial discrimination. Causal methods naturalize the distinction between direct (and thus discriminatory) effects of race and indirect (and thus legitimate) effects of race, creating what looks like a successful way to bootstrap formal statistical or experimental methods into substantive moral and political judgments. Showing how these approaches perform this remarkable sleight of hand will allow us to better see when social scientific methods are—and are not—well-suited to answer our most urgent questions about injustice."*
