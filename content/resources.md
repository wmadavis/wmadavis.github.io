*Using this space to collate academic resources I’ve personally found the most constructive. I make this qualification because plenty of advice I’ve seen widely circulated over the years absolutely would not work for me: my advice for reading advice is to feel emboldened to reject it.*

### Preparing for grad school

+ A guide to full-time research assistant positions (jobs now called “pre-docs”) as a stepping stone to quantitative social-science PhDs [(Coly Elhai, Quan Le, Kai Matheson, and Carolyn Tsao)](https://raguide.github.io/)
+ [Taking off the academic blinders](/posts/0003)
+ [Thoughts on the first year of an economics PhD](/posts/0002)
+ I have made some of my notes from the PhD coursework sequences from both my graduate schools available on here in the past but [Luke Stein’s impeccable notes on the Stanford core sequence](https://faculty.babson.edu/lcdstein/steincoresummary.pdf) put them to shame.

### Academic skill development

+ [Programming cheat sheets for R packages](https://posit.co/resources/cheatsheets/)
    + For most social science applications, the sheets on *dplyr*, *tidyr*, *stringr*, and *ggplot2* are most useful
    + *magrittr*, *purrr*, and R Markdown are vastly underused, imo
    + Equivalents for $tata [here](https://geocenter.github.io/StataTraining/)
+ How to critique academic work, helpful for referee reports and seminar discussion [(Macartan Humphreys)](https://macartan.github.io/teaching/how-to-critique)
+ How to build an economic model in your spare time [(Hal Varian](https://people.ischool.berkeley.edu/~hal/Papers/how.pdf))
+ Most academics taught themselves how to code. Some tips here (specific to R) on remedying bad practices you probably picked up by doing so. ([Jennifer Bryan and Jim Hester](https://rstats.wtf/), particularly Sections 2 and 3 on project-oriented workflows)
+ The anatomy of an applied micro talk [(Jesse Shapiro)](https://scholar.harvard.edu/files/shapiro/files/applied_micro_slides.pdf)
+ A style guide for mathematical writing ([Donald E. Knuth, Tracy Larrabee, and Paul M. Roberts)](https://jmlr.csail.mit.edu/reviewing-papers/knuth_mathematical_writing.pdf), particularly Section 1)

### Doing research

The transition from coursework to research [(Paul Niehaus)](https://medium.com/@paul.niehaus/doing-research-18cb310529e0)

> *"An alternative way to create structure is to focus on your system. By system I mean the habits and routines you develop and practice on a regular basis. For example, attending the seminar each week, writing down three suggestions for ways to improve the paper, and meeting afterwards with a classmate to discuss your ideas is a practice you might incorporate into your system. In designing your system, your aim is to give yourself a high probability of eventually accomplishing your ultimate goal (come up with a great job market paper) even though you cannot predict with any certainty the sequence of events through which this will come about."*

How to find research ideas, among other valuable insights on topics such as co-authoring and choosing journals to submit to [(Susan Athey, int. Simon Bowmaker](https://static1.squarespace.com/static/56ec62678a65e20b89da5f33/t/5f481c378f691221f1a3fda8/1598561335875/athey.pdf), pp. 6-8)

> *"My econometric theory was very similar. I’d be working on an empirical paper, and I’d say, “How can I think about the conditions under which this empirical approach would work?” And I would read papers with informal descriptions of the reasoning, and I would be dissatisfied. And so I would say, “Let me write this down, and if I do it formally, maybe then I’ll understand.” As I started writing things down, I would realize that there was a deeper, more general idea. And I felt that other people would benefit from having that clarity of conceptual insights in their own empirical work, and so I wrote it into econometric theory papers. Almost all of my very theoretical papers have been motivated by trying to solve an applied theory problem, and realizing that I would have more clarity about the specific problem if I understood the generality."*
