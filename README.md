# Minimalist Hugo Template for Academic Websites

This repository contains the source code to https://wmadavis.com, an academic website created with [Hugo](https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo) and [PaperMod](https://github.com/adityatelange/hugo-PaperMod) via the modifications made by [Pascal Michaillat](https://github.com/pmichaillat/pmichaillat.github.io). The website is hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/about-github-pages).


## Documentation

PaperMod variables are documented at https://adityatelange.github.io/hugo-PaperMod/posts/papermod/papermod-variables/.

## Features

The PaperMod theme is modified in several ways to be more adapted to academic websites:

+ Organization of the pages in three categories, which are available from any page through the menu and from the home page through buttons: 
	* Papers
	* Courses
	* Design projects
+ Automatically generated list of tags (keywords) used in papers and courses
+ New social icons specific to academia:
	* Office hours
	* Zoom
	* Substack
	* Google Scholar
+ Page metadata tailored to the academic context
+ Personalized color scheme, font, spacing, buttons, and general appearance
+ New archetypes for paper pages, course pages, an archive page, and a search page
